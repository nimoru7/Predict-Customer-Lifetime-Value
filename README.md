# Predict-Customer-Lifetime-Value
Built a predictive model to estimate customer lifetime value (CLV) for a mid-sized e-commerce company. Used Python with pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to clean multi-source data, engineer relevant features, and apply regression techniques. The model helped identify high-value customers for targeted marketing strategies.
